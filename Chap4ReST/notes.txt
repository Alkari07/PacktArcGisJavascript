- typically, GIS servers are exposed over port 6080 (usually configured for port 80 or https 443)
    -typical breakdown
    http://<GIS Server name>:6080/<site name, usually arcgis>/rest/services

- Mandatory REST service endpoints for Map services
    - Legend
    - Export Map (download an image in a BBox)
    - identify (all layers at a geometry)
    - find

- Feature services are similar to map services but provide more functionality:
    - editing of content
    - display feature symbology without a legend service
    - symbology can be edited clientside by renderer
    - can support versioned data (audit tables / undo)
    - offline editing and sync
    - 
- field names (name) cannot have  spaces or some characters
    - the alias is the display name string

- domain defines what values are valid for a field
    - range is a valid numerical range (ex: 1-5)
    - code is a list of valid entries and the code 

- You can specify an "out" spatial reference to have arc Server do the geospatial conversion calculation

- polygons are a list of points where the last point is the same as the first

- Simple symbols: esri provides a series of simple symbols that can be defined by short json:
    - Simple line
    - simple marker (point)
    - simple fill (polygon)
    - picture marker
    - picture fill (polygon w/ picture)
    - text symbol (labels)
- You won't usually see symbol json passed between server and client, but all symbol constructors in the API
    accept json objects
