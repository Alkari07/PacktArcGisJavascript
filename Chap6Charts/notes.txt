- charting functionality is contained in 'dojox/charting'
    - there are both 2d and 3d charting options
    - action package includes custom chart events to make them interactive

- to load other js packages (such as more advanced charting), you need to import it as a package in the dojo config
    - then, you can load it up using AWD the same as anything else
    ex:
    require(['jquery'], function($) {
        //assigns the jquery package (imported through dojo.config) to the $ variable, so it can be used the same as we're used to 
        //in typical jquery uses
        
    })
